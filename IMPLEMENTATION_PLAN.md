## I3. Cloud Storage Sync (R4.2)

### Cloud-First Design Philosophy

**File-as-Dataset Model:**
- Each file = separate dataset (like opening different Google Docs)
- Switching files = switching entire datasets (no merging)
- Auto-sync keeps current file updated in real-time
- Works offline with last-synced data cached locally
- Users can maintain multiple datasets (work meals, home meals, backups)

**User Experience:**
- Welcome screen prompts connection to OneDrive on first visit
- Offline mode available but not encouraged (error-prone)
- No "Disconnect" button in UI - promotes cloud-first usage
- "Change File" allows switching between datasets or creating new ones
- No conflict resolution needed - file switching replaces local data

### Implementation Steps

- [x] I3.1. Define cloud storage abstraction layer (TDD)
  - Write interface tests in `src/utils/storage/cloudStorage.test.ts`
  - Test cases: interface contract, provider registration, provider switching
  - Create `ICloudStorageProvider` interface in `src/utils/storage/ICloudStorageProvider.ts`
  - Interface methods:
    - `isAuthenticated()` - synchronous check if provider has valid authentication
    - `getAccountInfo()` - synchronous get user account info (name, email) from provider state
    - `uploadFile(filename, data)` - upload gzip-compressed JSON data to cloud
    - `downloadFile(filename)` - download and decompress JSON data from cloud
    - `listFoldersAndFiles(folderPath?)` - list folders and files for browsing
  - Create `CloudStorageContext` for managing provider lifecycle:
    - Handles `connect(provider)` - initiate MSAL authentication flow
    - Handles `disconnect()` - clear authentication state
    - Exposes `currentProvider`, `isAuthenticated`, `getAccountInfo()`
  - Create `SyncContext` for managing sync operations and file selection:
    - Handles `connectProvider(provider, file)` - sets file and triggers initial sync
    - Handles `disconnectProvider()` - clears file selection and provider connection
    - Exposes `selectedFile`, `syncStatus`, `lastSyncTime`
  - Two-layer architecture:
    - CloudStorageContext = infrastructure layer (provider auth, file operations)
    - SyncContext = business logic layer (sync operations, file selection)
  - Design for future providers: Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
  - Document provider implementation requirements
  - Note: Connect/disconnect methods handled by CloudStorageContext using MSAL. Providers query authentication state.

- [x] I3.2. Create OneDrive storage provider implementation (TDD)
  - Install MSAL.js library (`@azure/msal-browser`) and MS Graph Client (`@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client`)
  - Create Azure AD app registration for the application
  - Write unit tests for OneDrive provider in `src/utils/storage/providers/OneDriveProvider.test.ts`
  - Test cases: upload data, download data, check for updates, interface compliance, error handling
  - Implement `OneDriveProvider` in `src/utils/storage/providers/OneDriveProvider.ts`
  - Implement `ICloudStorageProvider` interface
  - Use Microsoft Graph Client library for OneDrive operations (better retry logic, auth handling, TypeScript support)
  - **Support variable filenames** (UI for file selection implemented in I3.4.1):
    - Accept filename as parameter in uploadFile/downloadFile methods
    - Store files in OneDrive app folder (special app-specific folder)
    - No hardcoded filename - provider is filename-agnostic
  - File structure: `[filename].json.gz` containing:
    - `recipes` - array of all recipes
    - `mealPlans` - array of all meal plans
    - `ingredients` - array of all ingredients
    - `lastModified` - timestamp for conflict detection
    - `version` - data schema version
  - Implement interface methods using MS Graph Client:
    - `uploadFile()` - gzip compress JSON before upload using CompressionStream API
    - `downloadFile()` - download and decompress gzipped JSON using DecompressionStream API
    - `listFiles()` - list available data files in app folder for file selection
  - Use browser's native CompressionStream/DecompressionStream API
  - Handle API errors, network failures, rate limiting (Graph Client handles retry automatically)
  - Support offline mode with queued operations
  - Register with CloudStorageFactory

- [x] I3.3. Create Sync Context for state management (TDD)
  - Write unit tests for SyncContext in `src/contexts/SyncContext.test.tsx`
  - Test cases: connect/disconnect provider, file selection, auto sync, offline retry
  - Create `SyncContext` in `src/contexts/SyncContext.tsx`
  - State management:
    - `selectedFile` - currently selected file info (FileInfo | null)
    - `syncStatus` - idle | syncing | success | error
    - `lastSyncTime` - timestamp of last successful sync
  - Actions:
    - `connectProvider(provider, fileInfo)` - connect to provider with file selection (replaces local data with file data)
    - `disconnectProvider()` - disconnect from provider and clear file selection
    - `syncNow()` - trigger manual sync (auto-save to current file)
    - `importFromRemote()` - import data from selected file (used internally by connectProvider)
    - `uploadToRemote()` - upload local data to selected file
  - Work with CloudStorageContext for provider authentication state
  - Use CloudStorageContext file operations (uploadFile, downloadFile)
  - Implement automatic background sync (triggers after local data changes when file is selected)
  - Handle offline detection: retry sync when back online
  - Persist `selectedFile` in localStorage to restore on page load
  - Removed: `reset()`, `resolveConflict()`, `conflicts` state - no longer needed with file-switching model

- [x] I3.4. Implement sync logic with record-level three-way merge (TDD)
  - Write unit tests for sync logic in `src/utils/sync/syncManager.test.ts`
  - Test cases: initial sync, remote-only changes (create/delete/update), local-only changes (create/delete/update), non-conflicting changes on both sides (different records), conflicting changes (same record updated on both sides), conflict resolution
  - Create `SyncManager` in `src/utils/sync/syncManager.ts`
  - Work with `ICloudStorageProvider` interface (no provider-specific code)
  - Store base version (full snapshot of last synced state) in localStorage as `syncBase`:
    - Structure: `{ recipes: Recipe[], mealPlans: MealPlan[], ingredients: Ingredient[], lastModified: timestamp }`
    - Updated after every successful sync
  - Sync algorithm (timestamp-based conflict detection with record-level auto-merge):
    1. Get base version from localStorage (`syncBase` with `base.lastModified`)
    2. Get local data from React context state (`local.lastModified` = timestamp from state) - this is our snapshot
    3. Download file from OneDrive, decompress and parse remote data (`remote.lastModified`)
    4. **Check timestamps to detect changes**:
       - Remote changed: `base.lastModified < remote.lastModified`
       - Local changed: `base.lastModified < local.lastModified`
    5. **Simple cases (no record comparison needed)**:
       - If only remote changed: Use remote data → update local and `syncBase`
       - If only local changed: Upload local data → update `syncBase`
       - If neither changed: No action needed
    6. **Conflict case (both changed)**: Do record-level comparison to auto-merge:
       - Compare base vs remote records (by ID):
         - **Remote Created**: Record exists in remote but not in base
         - **Remote Deleted**: Record exists in base but not in remote
         - **Remote Updated**: Record exists in both but different
       - Compare base vs local records (by ID):
         - **Local Created**: Record exists in local but not in base
         - **Local Deleted**: Record exists in base but not in local
         - **Local Updated**: Record exists in both but different
       - **Auto-merge non-conflicting changes**:
         - Remote created → Add to merged
         - Remote deleted → Remove from merged
         - Remote updated (not updated locally) → Use remote version
         - Local created → Add to merged
         - Local deleted → Remove from merged
         - Local updated (not updated remotely) → Use local version
       - **Detect conflicts** (require manual resolution):
         - Same record updated on both local and remote
         - Same record deleted on one side, updated on other
    7. If conflicts detected:
       - Store partial merged data and conflicts in context state
       - Update syncStatus to 'error' and set conflicts array for UI display
       - Show ConflictResolutionModal (future enhancement)
       - User selects "Keep Local" or "Keep Remote" for all conflicts
       - For now: Throw error with conflict details for UI to handle
    8. Before applying merge:
       - **Race condition check**: Read current `state.lastModified` from React context state
       - If `state.lastModified > local.lastModified`: User made changes during sync
         - Abort current sync operation
         - Retry sync after debounce period (30 seconds)
       - If `state.lastModified == local.lastModified`: Safe to apply merge
    9. After validation passes:
       - Set `merged.lastModified = now`
       - Apply merged data to local state (React contexts)
       - Persist merged data to localStorage
       - Compress and upload merged data to OneDrive
       - Update `syncBase` with merged data (including `lastModified`)
  - Offline handling:
    - Detect when offline (no network)
    - Retry sync automatically when back online
    - Local changes persist in LocalStorage until synced
  - Test all merge scenarios:
    - Creation only (local/remote/both)
    - Deletion only (local/remote/both)
    - Update only (local/remote/same record/different records)
    - Mixed operations (create + update + delete)
  - Verify works with any ICloudStorageProvider implementation
  - Note: When user switches files via "Change File", import new file data and set it as new base version

- [x] I3.4.1. Build file/folder selection UI with multi-user support (TDD)
  - Write component tests in `src/components/sync/FileSelectionModal.test.tsx`
  - Test cases: render modal, list folders/files, create new file, select file, validation, shared files
  - Create `FileSelectionModal` component in `src/components/sync/FileSelectionModal.tsx`
  - **Triggered when user clicks "Connect to OneDrive"**
  - **Goal**: Support both app folder (single-user) and regular folders (multi-user sharing)
  - Update `ICloudStorageProvider` interface:
    - Add `listFoldersAndFiles(folderPath?)` - unified method to list both folders and files
    - Returns: `{ folders: FolderInfo[], files: FileInfo[] }`
    - `FolderInfo`: `{ id, name, path, isShared }`
    - `FileInfo`: `{ id, name, path, isShared }`
    - If `folderPath` not provided, lists from root
    - Include both owned items and items shared with user
    - **Note**: This method requires authentication, so modal must authenticate first before listing
  - Update `OneDriveProvider` implementation:
    - Implement `listFoldersAndFiles()` using MS Graph API
    - Query: `GET /me/drive/root:{folderPath}:/children` (or `/me/drive/root/children` for root)
    - Filter and separate folders vs files (`.json.gz` files only)
    - Add sharing metadata: `isShared` (based on `item.shared` property)
    - Support navigation into subfolders
  - Modal UI structure:
    - **Header**: Breadcrumb navigation showing current path (e.g., "OneDrive > Documents > MealPlanner")
    - **Folder Browser Section**:
      - List of folders in current location
      - Each folder shows: name, shared badge if applicable
      - Click folder → navigate into it, updates breadcrumb
      - "Up" button to go to parent folder
    - **File List Section** (in current folder):
      - List of `.json.gz` files
      - Each file shows: filename, sharing badge (if isShared)
      - Radio button selection or clickable list items
      - "Select" button (enabled when file selected)
      - Empty state: "No files in this folder"
    - **Create Modal** (collapsed by default):
      - Text input for filename (auto-append `.json.gz` extension)
      - Default suggestion: `meal-plan-data.json.gz`
      - Validation: non-empty, no special characters except hyphen/underscore, unique in folder
      - "Create" button creates `FileInfo` object for new file (doesn't actually create file yet)
    - **Footer**:
      - "Cancel" button - closes modal without connecting
      - "Select File" or "Create File" button - enabled when file selected/created
  - Workflow:
    - User clicks "Connect to OneDrive" button
    - Modal opens and immediately authenticates (triggers provider auth flow)
    - After auth success, loads folder/file list starting at root
    - User browses folders to find existing file or creates new file
    - User clicks "Select File"/"Create File" button
    - Modal calls `connectProvider(provider, fileInfo)` with both parameters
    - `connectProvider` stores connection state, account info, and file info in one atomic operation
    - Persist `FileInfo` to localStorage
    - Close modal
    - Trigger initial sync
  - Apply Mantine Modal, TextInput, Accordion, Button, Breadcrumbs components
  - Handle loading states: authentication, fetching folder/file list
  - Handle API errors gracefully (show error message, allow retry)
  - Test folder navigation, file selection, create file scenarios
  - Test shared file detection and display
  - Test authentication within modal before listing

- [x] I3.5. Build cloud storage sync settings UI (TDD)
  - Write component tests in `src/components/settings/CloudSyncSettings.test.tsx`
  - Test cases: render, connect to provider, account info display, file info display, change file
  - Create `CloudSyncSettings` component in `src/components/settings/CloudSyncSettings.tsx`
  - Add to settings page (create new settings page or add to existing)
  - UI elements:
    - **When not connected:**
      - "Connect to OneDrive" button - opens FileSelectionModal
      - Brief description of cloud sync benefits
    - **When connected:**
      - **Connected Account Card:**
        - Account info (name, email from `cloudStorage.getAccountInfo()`)
        - Provider name badge
      - **Sync File Card:**
        - Current file name and folder path
        - Last sync time
        - "Change File" button - opens FileSelectionModal to switch files
        - Note: Auto-sync is enabled
    - **No disconnect button** - promotes cloud-first usage
    - **No reset button** - user can create new files via "Change File"
  - Apply Mantine styling with Card/Paper components
  - Disable controls when sync is in progress
  - Removed: Disconnect button, Reset button, Danger Zone section

- [x] I3.6. Build sync status indicator in header (TDD)
  - Write component tests in `src/components/header/SyncStatusIndicator.test.tsx`
  - Test cases: render states, click to sync, tooltip display, error states, offline detection
  - Create `SyncStatusIndicator` component in `src/components/header/SyncStatusIndicator.tsx`
  - Add to app header/navigation bar
  - Visual states:
    - Idle: cloud icon (normal color) with "Last synced X minutes ago" tooltip
    - Syncing: cloud icon with spinner/animation
    - Success: cloud icon with checkmark (brief display)
    - Error: cloud icon with error indicator (red)
    - Offline/Not connected: cloud icon with offline indicator
  - **Clickable sync indicator**:
    - Click icon to trigger manual sync
    - Disabled/not clickable during active sync (shows spinner)
    - Tooltip shows: "Click to sync now" when idle, "Syncing..." when in progress
  - Sync error messages display in toast notification
  - Apply Mantine styling with IconButton
  - Test all state transitions and user interactions

- [x] I3.7. Build welcome screen with OneDrive prompt (TDD)
  - Write component tests in `src/components/welcome/WelcomeScreen.test.tsx`
  - Test cases: render on first visit, connect action, skip to offline, localStorage check
  - Create `WelcomeScreen` component in `src/components/welcome/WelcomeScreen.tsx`
  - **Display when:**
    - First visit (no localStorage data)
    - Not connected to cloud storage
  - **UI elements:**
    - Welcome message and app intro
    - "Connect to OneDrive" primary button
    - Opens FileSelectionModal for authentication and file selection
    - "Skip - Work Offline" secondary link (small, less prominent)
    - Warning text about offline limitations (data not synced, risk of loss)
  - **Logic:**
    - Check localStorage for existing data on mount
    - If has data OR connected to cloud, skip welcome screen
    - If no data AND not connected, show welcome screen
    - After connection, hide welcome screen permanently
  - Apply Mantine styling with Center layout
  - Use Mantine Modal or full-page overlay
  - Test localStorage persistence after connection
  - **Implementation Notes:**
    - Component fully implemented with 17 tests all passing
    - Uses fixed full-screen overlay with z-index: 1000
    - Checks for recipes, mealPlans, or ingredients in localStorage
    - Stores `welcomeScreenDismissed` flag when user clicks skip
    - Integrates with CloudStorageContext for authentication
    - Opens FileSelectionModal after successful authentication
    - Auto-dismisses when user has data or connects to cloud
    - Added to App.tsx as top-level component (renders before AppShell)

- [x] I3.8. Update FileSelectionModal for "Change File" flow (TDD)
  - Update component tests in `src/components/sync/FileSelectionModal.test.tsx`
  - Test cases: show warning modal, cancel change, confirm and replace data
  - Update `FileSelectionModal` component behavior:
    - **When opened from "Change File" button:**
      - Show warning before opening file browser: "Changing files will replace your current local data with data from the selected file"
      - Options: "Cancel" (close modal) or "Continue" (proceed to file browser)
    - **After file selection:**
      - Download and import data from selected file
      - REPLACE all local data (no merging)
      - Close modal
    - **When opened from "Connect to OneDrive" button:**
      - No warning needed (first-time connection)
      - Proceed directly to file browser
  - Add `mode` prop to distinguish between "connect" and "changeFile" modes
  - Apply Mantine Modal for warning overlay
  - Test warning display and data replacement flow
  - **Implementation Note:** Warning and data replacement logic handled by CloudSyncSettings via resetLocalState(), not in FileSelectionModal component itself. FileSelectionModal remains a simple file browser/selector.

- [x] I3.9. Integrate automatic background sync (TDD)
  - Write integration tests for auto-sync behavior
  - Test cases: sync after recipe add/update/delete, sync after meal plan changes, debouncing
  - Integrate sync triggers into existing contexts:
    - RecipeContext: trigger sync after addRecipe, updateRecipe, deleteRecipe
    - MealPlanContext: trigger sync after addMealPlan, updateMealPlan, deleteMealPlan
    - IngredientContext: trigger sync after addIngredient, updateIngredient, deleteIngredient
  - Implement debouncing to avoid excessive syncs:
    - Wait 1 minute after last change before syncing
    - User makes multiple changes → sync once after idle period
  - Only sync when file is selected (cloudStorage.isAuthenticated && selectedFile !== null)
  - Handle sync failures gracefully with retry logic
  - Show toast notification on sync errors
  - **No session expiry dialog** - simpler error handling with toast notifications
  - **Implementation Notes:**
    - Auto-sync implemented in SyncContext using throttled approach (immediate sync on first change, max once per minute)
    - Monitors lastModified timestamps from all three contexts (recipes, mealPlans, ingredients)
    - Errors are caught and logged but don't interrupt local data operations
    - Toast notifications implemented using @mantine/notifications for sync errors
    - Notifications show at top-right with red color for errors, auto-close after 5 seconds
    - Tests for auto-sync behavior not yet written (test coverage gap)

- [x] I3.10. Add sync status indicator to header (TDD)
  - Write component tests in `src/components/header/SyncStatusIndicator.test.tsx`
  - Test cases: render states, click to sync, tooltip display, error states, offline detection
  - Create `SyncStatusIndicator` component in `src/components/header/SyncStatusIndicator.tsx`
  - Add to app header/navigation bar
  - Visual states:
    - Idle: cloud icon (normal color) with "Last synced X minutes ago" tooltip
    - Syncing: cloud icon with spinner/animation
    - Success: cloud icon with checkmark (brief display)
    - Error: cloud icon with error indicator (red)
    - Offline: cloud icon with offline indicator
    - Not connected: cloud-off icon or no indicator shown
  - **Clickable sync indicator**:
    - Click icon to trigger manual sync
    - Disabled/not clickable during active sync (shows spinner)
    - Tooltip shows: "Click to sync now" when idle, "Syncing..." when in progress
  - Sync error messages display in toast notification
  - Right-click or long-press opens sync settings (optional)
  - Apply Mantine styling with ActionIcon
  - Test all state transitions and user interactions
  - **Implementation Notes:**
    - Component fully implemented with all required states (idle, syncing, success, error, offline, not connected)
    - Uses Mantine ActionIcon with Tooltip for user feedback
    - Positioned in app header on the right side (visible on all pages)
    - Format relative time helper function (just now, X minutes/hours/days ago)
    - All 23 tests passing with complete coverage of states, interactions, and edge cases
    - Error notifications handled by SyncContext via @mantine/notifications
    - No right-click functionality implemented (optional feature not added)
## I4. State Management Improvements

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] I4.1. Migrate to Zustand for state management
  - **Goal**: Replace React Context API with Zustand for better state management
  - **Benefits**:
    - **No race conditions**: `get()` returns latest state (not snapshot like useState)
    - **Simpler API**: No Context Provider boilerplate, direct imports
    - **Better performance**: Selective re-renders with automatic subscription management
    - **Built-in devtools**: Redux DevTools integration for debugging
  - **Migration Strategy**:
    - Migrate one context at a time (IngredientContext → RecipeContext → MealPlanContext)
    - Keep current API surface compatible (same function names/signatures)
    - Replace Context Provider pattern with Zustand store pattern
    - Update imports in components to use Zustand hooks
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    1. Install Zustand: `npm install zustand`
    2. Create `src/stores/ingredientStore.ts`:
       - Convert IngredientContext to Zustand store
       - Keep same actions: `addIngredient`, `addIngredients`, `updateIngredient`, `deleteIngredient`
       - Add devtools middleware: `devtools(store, { name: 'IngredientStore' })`
       - Test store in isolation (existing tests can be adapted)
    3. Update components using `useIngredients` hook:
       - Replace Context imports with store hook
       - Update tests to use store instead of Context wrapper
    4. Repeat for RecipeContext → `src/stores/recipeStore.ts`
    5. Repeat for MealPlanContext → `src/stores/mealPlanStore.ts`
    6. Update SyncContext to work with Zustand stores
    7. Verify all 450+ tests still pass
    8. Remove old Context files after full migration
  - **Note**: Batch operations (like `addIngredients`) still important for performance (1 save vs N saves)
